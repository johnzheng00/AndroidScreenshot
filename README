screenshot

This is a project for generating screenshots of Android devices via DDMS.
The Java source was derived from the Android source code in: sdk/screenshot

The goal is to produce a simple Java app that can quickly and easily take
screenshots of Android devices connected to the host computer via USB from
the command line.

Presently this will build and run properly using something like:
  alias screenshot='java -jar /usr/local/share/screenshot.jar'
